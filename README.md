## Designing Database Management System for E-Library
Library is an institution that professionally manages collections of written, printed, and/or recorded works with a standardized system to meet the needs of education, research, preservation, information, and recreation for its patrons. In this digital era, digital libraries are highly sought after, especially by the younger generation, due to the ease of access and flexibility they offer.
